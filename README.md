===============================

loading the index.html will start the game immediately.

Use arrows to move the player(boy) around grass and stone tiles.

The goal is to reach the water or the star on the other side of the playground without hitting the bugs. The player has 3 lives before the game restart and load the 1st level.

When you reach the water at the other side, the player can collect 50 points. The star in the water will give the player 150 points. When the player is  hit by the bugs, he losts 100 points and one life. 

When the player get 300 points, the game is reload and he restart with the next level ( i.e level+1)

When rocks replace the stones(level 2 and higher). The rock is an obtacle for the player but not for bugs. The bugs can cross the rock but not the player.

Not yet implemented :

- When the player get 900 points, the player win
